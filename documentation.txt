fNbytesFree = No. of junk bytes in the file

fVersion = Version of ROOT being used(Follow ROOT)

fUUID = Identifier unique to each ROOT file

fEND = Size of file

TKey

fNbytes = fObjlen + fKeylen = Number of bytes occupied by this TKey

(Summation of fNbytes of all TKey) + fBEGIN + fNbytesFree = fEND

fVersion = Version of that instance(Follow ROOT)

fDatime = Date and time (Need to figure out format)

fSeekPdir = 100?

fCycle = Recursive Iteration level?
